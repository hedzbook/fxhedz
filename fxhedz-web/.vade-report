# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for this Next.js App Router project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Dependencies
- Added `@vercel/analytics` package via npm
- Updated `package.json` with the new dependency
- Updated `package-lock.json` with resolved dependencies

### 2. Modified Files

#### `app/layout.tsx`
- Added import: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next"`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after the `<Providers>` section
- This placement ensures analytics tracking is initialized for all pages in the application

## Implementation Details

This is an App Router project (Next.js 16.1.6) with TypeScript, so the Analytics component was added to the root layout file (`app/layout.tsx`). The component is placed at the end of the body, which is the recommended approach as it:
- Doesn't block the rendering of main content
- Properly tracks all page views and interactions
- Follows Vercel's best practices for App Router projects

## Verification

✓ Build completed successfully with no errors
✓ Linter ran successfully (pre-existing linting issues are unrelated to this change)
✓ All changes staged and ready for commit

## Notes

The Analytics component will automatically track:
- Page views
- Web Vitals metrics
- User interactions

No additional configuration is required. The analytics data will be available in the Vercel dashboard once the application is deployed.
