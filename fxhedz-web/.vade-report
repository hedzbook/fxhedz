Configured Vercel Web Analytics for Next.js App Router

Summary:
--------
Successfully configured Vercel Web Analytics in this Next.js App Router project.

Changes Made:
-------------
1. Modified app/layout.tsx:
   - Added <Analytics /> component inside the <body> tag, placed after the Providers component and {children}
   - The Analytics component was already imported from '@vercel/analytics/next' but not being used
   - Now properly configured to track page views and web vitals

Package Installation:
--------------------
- The @vercel/analytics package (v1.6.1) was already present in package.json
- No additional package installation was required
- Ran npm install to ensure dependencies are up to date
- package-lock.json was already in sync, no changes needed

Verification:
------------
- Build completed successfully with no errors
- Linting passed for the modified file (no new errors introduced)
- The Analytics component is now properly placed in the root layout
- Web analytics will be automatically enabled when deployed to Vercel

Implementation Details:
----------------------
This is an App Router project (using the app directory), so the Analytics component was added to:
- File: app/layout.tsx
- Location: Inside the <body> tag, after the main content
- Placement follows Vercel's recommended practice for App Router projects

The implementation is minimal and non-invasive, preserving all existing functionality while adding analytics tracking capabilities.
